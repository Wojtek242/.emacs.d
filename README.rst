.emacs.d
========

My personal Emacs configuration.  It comes with a heavily modified version of
the ``underwater`` theme available from the Emacs repos.

Installation
------------

Just clone this repository into your home directory:

::

   git clone https://github.com/Wojtek242/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d

It uses a simple addition to the built-in package management called EModule_.

Under development
-----------------

I expect this configuration to stall at certain points.  I am hoping to iron
out these cases as I stumble upon them.
